<h2>Packages Required to run Blitz</h2>

<h3>JDK 1.4.x</h3>

Available from <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java.sun.com</a>
<h3>JINI 2.1</h3>

<p>Available from <a href="https://starterkit.dev.java.net/">starterkit.dev.java.net</a></p>

<p>Note that Blitz will run against JINI 2.0 however any existing
scripts you have will need adjusting for backward compatibility.
</p>

<h3>Brian Murphy's JINI 2.x Starter scripts and configuration</h3>

<p>These are not strictly necessary, but they are used
extensively in the examples throughout the documentation. If you do not
wish to follow along with the examples, you needn't install this
package. However, these scripts do make managing a JINI environment a
lot easier so it's worth the trouble!</p>

<p>Scripts for JINI 2.1 are available from <a href="http://www.dancres.org/cottage/jini-start-examples-2_1.zip">here</a>.
Scripts for JINI 2.0.x are available from the <a href="http://www.dancres.org/cottage/jini-start-examples.zip">here</a>.</p>

<p>Be sure to read the installation notes carefully!</p>

<h2>Additional Packages required to compile Blitz</h2>

<p>If you just want to run Blitz using the binary distribution
you don't need any of these packages.</p>

<h3>Ant 1.5.3</h3>

<p>Available from <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache.org</a></p>
