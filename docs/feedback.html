<h1>Reporting Bugs, Providing Feedback or Asking Questions</h1>


<p>In emergency, contact us directly at <a href="mailto:blitz@dancres.org">dancres.org</a>.
However, we would prefer that you use the site at SourceForge (we
receive email advisories whenever you update the trackers). &nbsp;By
entering your issues, requests etc as SourceForge you are helping to
build a knowledgebase for other users and we can potentially spot
trends and over-arching issues.</p>


<h2>Providing Feedback</h2>


If you wish to suggest/discuss enhancements, please submit your request <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=705210&amp;group_id=126322&amp;func=browse">using the enhancements tracker</a>

<h2>Asking Questions</h2>


If you have questions about configuring or using Blitz (including application patterns etc), please submit your question <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=705208&amp;group_id=126322&amp;func=browse">using the support tracker</a>

<h2>Reporting Bugs</h2>


<p>Should you encounter what you believe is a bug, please submit details <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=705207&amp;group_id=126322&amp;func=browse">using the bug tracker</a>.  If you can, include:

</p>
<ol>

  <li> Which version of Blitz JavaSpaces you're using.</li>

  <li> Which JDK you're using.</li>

  <li> The relevant scripts and configuration files.</li>

  <li> A description of the problem. </li>

  <li> If you're getting an exception please include the <em>full</em> stack trace. </li>

  <li> 
    <p>If you're encountering a deadlock, please include a thread dump, if possible:</p>


	
    <ul>

	<li> On Windows, this is achieved by hitting CTRL+BREAK in the DOS window which is running the Blitz instance.</li>

	<li> On Solaris/Linux and other UNIX variants, this is achieved by
hitting CTRL+\ in the terminal which is running the Blitz instance.</li>

	
    </ul>
