<h2>Installation Choices</h2>

<h3>Installer</h3>

<h4>GUI Install</h4>

<p><b>Update:</b> Try the newer <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/blitzjavaspaces/files/Beta%20Installer/0.7%20-%20Blitz%202.1.1/">SWT-based installer</a> which contains all necessary dependencies including Jini.</p>

<p>If you're a new user or just want to get something up and
running, it's recommended that you download the installer which
includes a simple <code>readme</code> and does most of the configuration work for
you. The installer package is named <code>installer_pj_n_nn.jar</code>
where <code>n_nn</code> is the release version number.
Note that you'll still need to download and install the appropriate
version of JINI - see <a href="required_packages.html">required
packages</a>. &nbsp;To run the installer use <code>java
-jar</code> which will display a simple GUI for gathering paths
and port settings.</p>

<h4>Headless Install</h4>

<p>The installer can also be run in
headless mode (command-line install) where one should specify the paths
and port settings as follows:</p>


<pre>java -jar installer.jar JDK_Home Jini_Home Install_Dir HTTP_Port</pre>


<p>or</p>


<pre>java -jar installer.jar Jini_Home Install_Dir HTTP_Port </pre>

<a name="start"></a>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>


<p>First, ensure that you have installed the <a href="required_packages.html">required packages</a>.</p>


<p>Second, make sure that you have selected the appropriate backport-util for your chosen JDK. This should only be necessary if you chose not to use the SWT-based installer above. You will need to modify the configuration files (located in the <code>config</code> directory), substituting <code>backport-util-concurrent50.jar</code> with <code>backport-util-concurrent.jar</code> or <code>backport-util-concurrent60.jar</code>.</p>

<p>Blitz is fully integrated with JINI 2.1 so the preferred
method of startup is via the ServiceStarter. However, it's possible to
run Blitz, for test purposes, in a standalone mode.
</p>

<h3>Configuration Basics</h3>


<p>Blitz is configured via a configuration file such as the
example <a href="../config/blitz.config">blitz.config</a>
file. This file contains options for determining security
configuration, remote functions and core functions such as the storage
model (see above).
</p>


<p>Blitz implements a concept of Storage Models which allows the
user to customize the level of persistence provided. The default
setting is transient but, should you wish to change this, please read <a href="#storagemodels">Appendix A</a>.</p>


<p>Additional configuration files are required for use with the
ServiceStarter:</p>


<ul>


  <li> <a href="../config/activatable-group.config">activatable-group.config</a>
and <a href="../config/start-act-blitz.config">start-act-blitz.config</a>
are examples of configuration files suitable for starting an
Activatable instance of Blitz.</li>


  <li> <a href="../config/start-trans-blitz.config">start-trans-blitz.config</a>
is an example configuration file suitable for starting a
non-Activatable instance of Blitz.</li>


</ul>


<p>Regardless of the storage model chosen, Blitz may need to, at
least temporarily, persist it's state so ensure that you have properly
configured the appropriate entries in the core config file (these are
the configuration parameters <code>persistDir</code> and <code>logDir</code>
in the configuration file). This is also important should you wish to
"clean up" after a Blitz instance as you must delete the contents of
the persistence and log directories specified by the configuration
parameters.
</p>


<p><b>Note: You <em>must</em> configure the
persistence and log directories as described above. Other default
settings can be left alone though you should probably review the <code>initialGroups</code>
setting (particularly if you choose to not use Brian Murphy's scripts).
You should also look at increasing the cache sizes to suit your
hardware.</b></p>


<hr align="center" size="3" width="70%">

<h2><a name="memory">Memory Usage</a></h2>


<p><a name="memory">For background you should read
these:
</a></p>


<ul>


  <li><a href="http://jroller.com/page/dancres?entry=javaspaces_fallacies">JavaSpaces
Fallacies</a></li>


  <li><a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/dancres?entry=are_you_leaking_memory">Are
You Sure You're Leaking Memory?</a></li>


</ul>


<p>Blitz uses it's cache to hold both live and dead (taken or
lease expired) Entry's. It only clears it's cache once it is full.</p>


<p>i.e. If you set the cache size to 100 and you have only five
entry's with one writer and one taker, Blitz will have a cache
containing 5 live entries and 95 dead ones after things have run for a
while.</p>


<p><b>Important:</b> Each type of Entry is given it's
<em>own</em> cache (i.e. there isn't one cache shared
across all Entry's of all types). So approximate total memory usage (to
get an accurate figure would require estimating garbage requirements
etc) is:</p>


<pre>memory = 0;<br>for (X in all Entry types) {<br> memory = memory + (cache_size * size_of X)<br>}<br><br>memory = memory + Db database cache size</pre>


<p>Where Db database cache size is specified in the configuration
file under dbCache</p>


<p>Thus in OutOfMemory situations, the correct approach is to
reduce entry cache size or the db cache or increase available JVM heap
or a combination of the three. Note that in the case of a persistent
Blitz, you should also consider enabling log file serialization stream
reset by setting the first boolean parameter to the Persistent class
constructor (defined as the storageModel in the configuration file) to <code>true</code>.</p>


<p>Note that there is a tool (EntrySizer) in the Blitz
distribution (see Extensions in the documentation for your chosen
version) which can be used to compute the approximate size of an Entry
as it will be stored in Blitz's cache.</p>


<p>Note also that you can specify individual cache sizes per
Entry type using EntryConstraint examples of which can be found in the
configuration files. A good basic approach to using these constraints
would be to set <code>entryReposCacheSize</code> to
something small like 256 or 512 and then use the EntryConstraints to
allocate bigger caches (e.g. 1024, 4096) to specific Entry types.</p>


<p>In cases where you are submitting Blitz to high load for
sustained periods of time and the CPU usage is close to 100%, consider
enabling throttling to prevent overflow of internal queues. See <code>eventQueueBound</code>
and <code>taskQueueBound</code> in <a href="#appb">Appendix
B - Configuration Variables</a>.</p>


<a name="admin"></a>
<h2>Administration</h2>


<p>Blitz supports <code>JoinAdmin</code>, <code>DestroyAdmin</code>,
<code>JavaSpaceAdmin</code> and two custom management
interfaces (<code>BlitzAdmin</code> and <code>StatsAdmin</code>
and, therefore, can be managed by a variety of browser tools.</p>


<p>The first time a Blitz instance is started, it loads it's JINI
configuration information such as lookup groups and locators from it's
configuration file. These are then stored in a binary metadata file
along with the <code>serviceID</code> and various other
pieces of runtime information. <b>Future re-starts of the Blitz
instance will read the configuration information from the binary
metadata file (unless the StorageModel is Transient, in which case all
state is lost and the configuration file will be read again)</b>.
Thus, further configuration changes in respect of JINI state must be
done via JoinAdmin. Other non-JINI configuration information can be
changed in the configuration file and will take effect the next time
the Blitz instance is restarted.</p>


<p><code>DestroyAdmin::destroy</code> is usually
defined to shutdown the service instance and remove all it's persistent
state. As a convenience, Blitz provides a configuration variable, <code>compliantDestroy</code>,
which can be used to specify whether a Blitz instance should delete or
retain it's state when carrying out a destroy request. When <code>compliantDestroy</code>
is <code>false</code> Blitz simply shut's down in response
to a destroy call. If <code>compliantDestroy</code> is <code>true</code>
Blitz will delete all state before shutting down. If <code>compliantDestroy</code>
is not specified in the configuration file, the default is to retain
state when <code>destroy</code> is invoked.</p>


<p>It is my belief that, as well as destroy, there should be an
additional standardized method to trigger a shutdown whilst retaining
state. As there is no such standard, the <code>BlitzAdmin</code>
interface provides such a method.
</p>

<a name="storagemodels"></a>
<h2>Appendix A - Storage Models</h2>


<p>As of Blitz 2.0, it is possible to configure a number of
different persistence profiles. They are currently:</p>


<ol>


  <li><a href="javadocs/org/dancres/blitz/config/Persistent.html">Persistent</a>
- In this mode, Blitz behaves like a fully persistent JavaSpace such as
the persistent version of Outrigger.</li>


  <li><a href="javadocs/org/dancres/blitz/config/Transient.html">Transient</a>
- (default setting) causes Blitz to act like a disk-backed cache. In
this mode, Blitz behaves like the transient version of Outrigger. No
logging is performed and, when Blitz is restarted, all state (including
Join state etc.) is lost. Memory-only transient implementations can
halt with <code>OutOfMemoryError</code>'s if they are
over-filled. Blitz avoids this problem by swapping to disk when the
number of stored <code>Entry</code>'s overflows it's
available cache space. Obviously, performance will degrade relative to
the amount of swapping Blitz is required to perform. When the caches
are sufficiently large, Blitz will make minimal use of disk, yielding
maximal performance.</li>


  <li><a href="javadocs/org/dancres/blitz/config/TimeBarrierPersistent.html">TimeBarrierPersistent</a>
- provides a performance versus persistence QoS tradeoff. In this mode,
changes made more than a certain number of milliseconds ago are
guarenteed to be persistent. More recent changes are <em>not
guarenteed</em> persistent but <em>may be</em>
persistent. This mode provides the developer with a means of balancing
persistence needs against performance.</li>


</ol>


<p>The actual model used is determined by the value of the
configuration variable <code>storageModel</code>. The
standard configuration file contains example settings for all three
modes which should provide reasonable starting points for more precise
tuning. For more details on the exact settings for each model see the
Javadoc for <code>org.dancres.blitz.config.Persistent</code>,
<code>org.dancres.blitz.config.Transient</code> and <code>org.dancres.blitz.config.TimeBarrierPersistent</code>.</p>


<hr align="center" size="3" width="70%">
<a name="appb"></a>
<h2>Appendix B - Configuration Variables</h2>


<h3>Basic Setup</h3>


<ul>


  <li><i>persistDir</i>=&lt;string&gt; - the
directory in which blitz will keep checkpointed state.</li>


  <li><i>logDir</i>=&lt;string&gt; - the
directory in which blitz will keep it's log files. If all log files are
present, Blitz can reconstitute the checkpointed state.</li>


  <li><i>storageModel</i>=&lt;type&gt; - see
Appendix A.</li>


</ul>


<h3>JINI-related options</h3>


<ul>


  <li><i>name</i>=&lt;string&gt; - configures
the name of the Blitz Instance. This value is made available on the
proxy as a Name attribute</li>


  <li><i>loginContext</i>=&lt;LoginContext&gt;
- sets the identity the Blitz instance will take on when it starts up.
Many security configurations will require this to be set.</li>


  <li><i>compliantDestroy</i>=&lt;Boolean&gt;
- see Administration section above.</li>


  <li><i>initialGroups</i>=&lt;String[]&gt; -
defines the collection of LUS groups under which a Blitz instance will
register on initial startup (after initial startup, groups are held in
an internal database which can be reconfigured via JoinAdmin.</li>


  <li><i>initialLocators</i>=&lt;LookupLocator[]&gt;
- set this to configure registration with specific LUS. This value is
only used for initial startup as initialGroups.</li>


  <li><i>initialAttrs</i>=&lt;Entry[]&gt; -
the Entry attributes to make available on the proxy as part of initial
startup. Behaviour is the same as for initialGroups and initialLocators.</li>


  <li><i>serverExporter</i>=&lt;Exporter&gt;
-
configures the JERI endpoint to be used by the Blitz instance. Allows
for configuration of tcp, ssl, https etc as the transport.</li>


  <li><i>*preparer</i>=&lt;ProxyPreparer&gt;
- defines the proxy preparer to be used to verify various remote
references which may be passed to a Blitz instance.</li>


  <li><i>*recoveredPreparer</i>=&lt;ProxyPreparer&gt;
- defines the proxy preparer to be used to verify a remote instance
recovered from the log/checkpoint storage during a restart.</li>


  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">loopbackTxnExporter</span>=&lt;Exporter&gt;
- configures and enables the loopback transaction manager which can be
used to accelerate transactions against this Blitz instance.
&nbsp;Note
it cannot be used to co-ordinate transactions amongst multiple
participants nor does it yet support security options. <span style="font-weight: bold;">[BETA]</span></li>


</ul>


<h3>Notify Subsystem</h3>


<ul>

  <li><i>syncNotifyOnWrite</i>=&lt;boolean&gt; - when enabled forces writes to wait
until all associated events have been processed. *IfExists is a significant performance drain and by default Blitz aggressively optimizes event delivery for those calls such that events from writes close to the resolution point may be ignored.  If you are using *IfExists and require completely deterministic behaviour, enable this option.  For those not using *IfExists leave this option disabled for better performance.</li>

  <li><i>maxEventProcessors</i>=&lt;int&gt; -
defines the maximum number of threads to be used to empty the notify
event queue and perform matching against notify templates. Defaults to
1.</li>


  <li><i>eventgenSaveInterval</i>=&lt;int&gt;
- the number of events to be generated against an event registration
before logging to disk.</li>


  <li><i>eventgenRestartJump</i>=&lt;int&gt;
- the number by which to advance the sequence number of an event
registration at recovery time. This "jump" is designed to allow an
end-user application to detect the fact that recovery has been
performed and that events may have been lost/never generated.</li>


</ul>


<h3>Lease Subsystem</h3>


<p>Allows control of leasing operation such as assigning a
maximum allowable lease time.</p>


<ul>


  <li><i>entryLeaseBound</i>=&lt;long&gt; -
sets the maximum lease permissible for an Entry. Set this to zero to
allow Lease.FOREVER</li>


  <li><i>notifyLeaseBound</i>=&lt;long&gt; -
sets the maximum lease permissible for a notify registration. Set this
to zero to allow Lease.FOREVER</li>


  <li><i>leaseReapInterval</i>=&lt;long&gt; -
the time between active scans for lease expired resources. Value should
be ms (0 disables active cleanup). Normally, Blitz uses read/take
activity to do cleanup (passive). If memory or disk resource is scarce,
configure this to non-zero to activate more aggressive cleaning (which,
in turn, is more CPU aggressive). Alternatively, you can enable manual
lease cleanup (via execution of <code>org.dancres.blitz.tools.RequestReap</code>
by setting this to <code>org.dancres.blitz.lease.LeaseReaper.MANUAL_REAP</code></li>


</ul>


<h3>Advanced Setup</h3>


<ul>


  <li><i>loadBackoff</i>=&lt;int[]&gt; -
configures the deadlock avoidance timings for loading entry's. Requires
a two int array consisting of base_backoff and the random jitter to
apply to that backoff.</li>


  <li><i>maxOidAllocators</i>=&lt;int&gt; -
the maximum number of allocators to use per Entry type for id
generation. Ids are never reused thus a small number of allocators may
run out of ids in highly concurrent take/write scenarios. More
allocators also improves concurrency.</li>


  <li><i>maxWriteThreads</i>=&lt;int&gt; -
should not be changed from the default value of 1.</li>


  <li><i>threadKeepAlive</i>=&lt;long&gt; -
ms before a write thread will be killed rather than pooled.</li>


  <li><i>maxTaskThreads</i>=&lt;int&gt; - the
maximum number of threads allowed for a task pool.</li>


  <li><i>entryReposReadahead</i>=&lt;int&gt;
- the maximum number of Entry's to fault in should the cache provide no
matches. Zero means readahead should be disabled. This is a global
setting which can be overidden with individual Entry constraints - see
the Javadoc for <code>org.dancres.blitz.config.EntryConstraint</code>.</li>

  <li><i>agents</i>=&lt;ColocatedAgent[]&gt;
- is an array of initializers to be run against the Blitz proxy before it 
is published via a join manager to lookup services.  See the javadoc for 
<code>org.dancres.blitz.remote.user.ColocatedAgent</code>.</li>

  <li><i>updateContents</i>=&lt;boolean&gt; - Determines whether the contents methods on <code>JavaSpaceAdmin</code> and <code>JavaSpace05</code> update their working match sets with entry's written after the set was created.  Note enabling this can mean that one never reaches the end of the match set or that the match set overflows memory if it fills faster than a client empties it.</li>

</ul>


<h3>Memory Management</h3>


<ul>


  <li><i>desiredPendingWrites</i>=&lt;int&gt;
- the number of writes to batch for disk update.</li>


  <li><i>throttlePendingWrites</i>=&lt;int&gt;
- the maximum number of writes to batch for disk update. If the queue
fills beyond this threshold (perhaps due to slow disks) throttling is
applied to foreground operations whilst disk catches up.</li>


  <li><i>dbCache</i>=&lt;int&gt; - the max
size of cache Db is allowed (bigger being better).</li>


  <li><i>maxDbTxns</i>=&lt;int&gt; - the
maximum number of transactions Db should support concurrently. Under
highly concurrent loads, increase this number.</li>


  <li><i>entryReposCacheSize</i>=&lt;int&gt;
- the maximum number of Entry's (per type) to cache. This is a global
setting which can be overidden with individual Entry constraints - see
the Javadoc for <code>org.dancres.blitz.config.EntryConstraint</code>.</li>

  <li><i>cacheEntriesPerPartition</i>=&lt;int&gt; - the maximum number of entries to place in each partition of the entry cache. In order to improve concurrent performance, each entry cache is broken up into a number of pieces that are separately locked. This entry determines the maximum size of each piece.</li>
  
  <li><i>eventQueueBound</i>=&lt;int&gt; -
limits the maximum size of the notify event queue - once full, writing
threads will be throttled down to prevent overflow. Defaults to
0(disabled)</li>


  <li><i>taskQueueBound</i>=&lt;int&gt; -
limits the maximum size of the task queue (used for processing new
writes against blocked takes or reads) - once full, writing threads
will be throttled down to prevent overflow. Defaults to 0(disabled)</li>


</ul>


<h3>Debug Options</h3>


<ul>


  <li><i>ignoreLogConfig</i>=&lt;Boolean&gt;
- when true, causes Blitz to ignore any logger <code>Level</code>
entrys in it's configuration file. This allows a developer to use the
standard logger configuration approach when appropriate.</li>


  <li><i>logCkpts</i>=&lt;Boolean&gt; - if
true, causes Blitz to generate a log message at each checkpoint</li>


  <li><i>statsDump</i>=&lt;long&gt; - pause in milliseconds which determines how often the stats are dumped to console. Setting this to zero disables stats dumping.</li>


  <li><i>stats</i>=&lt;Switch[]&gt; - Defines
the default
settings for stats gathering. See the Javadoc for <code>org.dancres.blitz.stats</code>.
This information is processed by Dashboard.</li>
