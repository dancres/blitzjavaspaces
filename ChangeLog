    * Fix up Rio config to use Jini 2.1 .jars

2006-02-02  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

    * Rewrite the contents() core.  It was just way too complex, had too much
    retro-fitting and there have been some complaints of duplicates which will
    be down to a hole in the overly complex locking scheme of the old version.

2006-02-01  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

    * Make sure we check for expired transactions in loopback mgr at time of
    commit or abort.

2006-01-29  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

    * Fix deadlock which can occur when an operation attempts to add state
    to TxnState whilst it is concurrently being resolved.  These operations
    should receive an exception indicating a user-programming error
    but instead cause deadlock.

    * Fix bug where we won't kill off associated notify's if we abort a
    non-null transaction.

2006-01-26  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

    * Make sure we close RandomAccessFiles used in logging to prevent some
    OS'en running out of file handles (some seem to cleanup on their own).

    * Released 1.21-pre3 (limited circulation)

2006-01-19  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

    * Add support for a loopback transaction manager which can be enabled by
    defining it's Exporter using the configuration variable loopbackTxnExporter.
    Note the manager can only be used to co-ordinate transactions against the
    blitz instance that it shares the JVM with. It cannot co-ordinate multiple
    and/or remote participants such as other Blitz instances
    [EXPERIMENTAL - USE AT YOUR PERIL]
    
2006-01-12  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

    * Fix bug in BlitzServiceImpl.newView where for JavaSpace05 compatibility
    we should only hold locks if the transaction is non-null.  Do the same
    for LocalSpace.  Thanks to Simon Vicary for the bug report and unit test

    * Released 1.21-pre2
    
2006-01-09  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

    * Remove unnecessary BitIndex copy from BitmapIndexer - BitIndex's are
    thread safe so we can iterate without copying.

2006-01-07  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

    * Revise transaction abort to spot situations where we needn't write an
    entry to disk even though we have operations.  This optimization is
    triggered when the associated transaction is active and thus no records
    have been written to disk such that undo can be done entirely in memory.

    * Fix an unlikely race condition where transaction operations could occur
    after a decision had been taken to optimize and not emit a log record to
    disk. These additional operations would invalidate the decision due to the
    changes in state wrought on a transaction.
     
2006-01-05  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

    * For write and write(Collection) have proxy populate stub and uuid fields
    to save on network traffic and serialization costs.

2006-01-04  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

2005-12-20  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

    * Released 1.20
    
2005-12-09  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

    * Make Blitz's internal view generation for contents methods strictly
    apply the entry limit so as to cap memory usage.

2005-12-08  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

    * Fix up nio experimental transport to allow clients to exit (convert
    Txer to use of Daemon threads).
    
2005-12-07  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

    * Add updateContents configuration variable which can be used to disable
    dynamic updating of contents views - useful for memory consumption control.

    * Released 1.13-pre9
    
2005-09-26  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

	a class.
	
2005-09-16  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

	* Removed the aging support from ArcCache because it penalizes

	* Fix race condition which could cause TxnPinger to abort a transaction
	that was just committed.

	* Internally Released 1.13-pre6
	
2005-09-02  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

	* Make FindEntryOpInfo aggressively sync Entry deletion in cases where
	the EntrySleeveImpl is on disk.  This ensures better performance in
	cases where we have to hit disk often such as swapping, cold-start
	or FIFO.

	* Released 1.13-pre5

	* Fix bug where transaction pinger might encounter
	UnknownTransactionException for a transaction just committed and
	then succeed with an abort thus erroneously undoing the transaction.
	
2005-08-30  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

	* Refactor oid package to remove external dependency on UIDImpl.
	Masking this makes it easier to introduce a new oid type as required for
	fault tolerance.

	* Released 1.13-pre3
	
2005-08-05  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

	* Revise persistent logger to use RandomAccessFile in sync mode which
	is slightly faster than forced sync's via Channel.  Note that buffer
	size for the logger becomes a significant tuning factor and should be
	sized to hold all concurrent transaction state at each log write.
	
2005-07-22  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

	* Added support for logging failed takes and reads for use with
	log dump tool.

	* Added versioning to Blitz log files

	* Added support for upgrade from 1.12 or less

	* Removed LoggableAction interface and support.  Converted all code to
	use of TxnOp which reduces duplication, increases generic code and
	prepares the way for fault tolerance (fault tolerance preparation).

	* Associate lease renewals against Entry's under a write lock with
	the transaction holding the lock rather than emitting them as
	independent records (fault tolerance preparation).
	
2005-07-21  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

	* Make DumpEntries correctly initialize Disk before attempting to 
	scan.

	* Fix a problem where CacheIndexers weren't always notified of Entry
	deletions leading to poor in-cache performance.
	
2005-07-15  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

	* Fix a deadlock around TxnLocks which occurs under high load when

	caused deadlock owing to attempts to re-acquire mutex.

2005-06-23  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

	* Fix lock conflict caused by parallel database existence tests and
	database creation (workaround for a Db issue).
	
2005-06-20  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

	* Make non-wildcard searches terminate immediately we determine there
	cannot be a match.

	* Reduce de-serialization in searches

	* Reduce de-serialization in handling of recent writes

2005-06-15  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

	* Released 1.09
	
2005-05-30  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

	* Change CacheIndexer default log level

	* Added ignoreLogConfig configuration variable to cause Blitz to ignore
	logger Level configuration entry's in it's configuration file.  This
	allows a developer to use the standard logger configuration approach
	when appropriate.
	
2005-04-04  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

	* Fix WriteEntryOpInfo to markDirty committed entries if they are
	not marked dirty when unpinned.  If they are pinned they can't have
	been written to disk yet and thus they should still be dirty but
	mightn't be if they got temporarily dropped into WriteScheduler due
	to cache pressure

	* Do a pre-check before executing some more costly logging statements

	* Don't bother asking for an Entry unless we're going to be able to
	actually initialize an indexer with it

	* Tune Db/Java to handle swapping better

	* Add a static serialVersionUID to DashboardUI::Factory to avoid
	problems with differences in Inca X releases

	DELETED Entry's which are wasted matches.  Fix CacheIndexers to ignore
	such Entry's

	* Added support for per-Entry type constraints.  See
	org.dancres.blitz.config.EntryConstraint

	* Added CacheSize constraint to override the global cache setting
	and set a cache size for a specific Entry type.  This replaces the
	old mechanism for setting Entry specific cache size - update your
	.config's accordingly

	* Added Fifo constraint to enforce FIFO ordering in searches and
	writes for a specific Entry type.

	* Added support for Entry browsing to Dashboard - contributed
	by Phil Bishop at Inca X

	* Released 1.07
	
2005-03-08  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

	* Make StartDashboard's timeout configurable via system property.
	To override the default timeout, specify -DmaxDiscover=<ms>

	* Released 1.06
	
2005-03-04  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

	* Added disableBitmaps boolean config variable to disable bitmap
	indexing if it proves un-performant or broken.
	
2005-03-03  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

	* Added support for JavaSpaceAdmin interface as implemented by
	Outrigger.  This will allow appropriate space browsers to interrogate
	and modify the contents of a Blitz instance.

	* Fix a bug where renew/cancel didn't manage stats correctly
	
2005-03-01  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

	* Moved reset of stats from SleeveCache::close to
	SleeveCache::deleteAll.

	* Added support for caching indexing using Bitmaps.  Applicable in
	situations where caches are of fixed size they are much quicker
	than the equivalent HashMapIndexer whilst having similar memory
	consumption in most cases.
	
2005-02-19  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

	* Added support for remote triggering of Entry cleanup.

	* SpaceImpl::find should abort a null transaction in face of exceptions
	not prepAndCommit

	* Upgraded to Db 1.7.1
	
2005-02-08  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

	* Fixed a nasty race condition in LockCache where an old reference
	can cause invalidation of a current lock.

	* Merge support from FT for individual Entry cache sizes.

	* Released 1.05
	
2005-01-13  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

	* Fix a deadlock which can occur in writing Entry's with small cachesize

	* Speculative deadlock fix which might occur in updating Entry's with
	small cachesize

	* Split retry/deadlock avoidance code into a framework (RetryingUpdate
	and RetryableOperation)

	* Use deadlock avoidance framework in various parts of EntryStorage

	* Relax isolation levels on disk-based tuple scans.  Reduces lock
	conflicts, lock demands and increases concurrency.  Also yields a
	performance improvement even in cache-restricted cases.

	* Big thanks to Dylan Wilson for all his testing and reporting effort
	that fuelled the above changes and has resulted in a better product.

	* Fixed the release scripts to uniquely name the installer to
	fix SourceForge name conflicts.

	* Released 1.04
	
2005-01-10  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

2004-12-31  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

	* Fix a minor problem where an abort can dump a non-fatal
	UnknownTransactionException during recovery.  Recovery will still
	complete and no damage has been done.

	* Fixed a bug in meta.Registry where initializer results were not
	forcible commited to disk.

	b1 or b2 - reduces memory footprint
	
2004-10-26  Dan Creswell <dan@dancres.org>

	* FindEntryOpInfo should not unpin an Entry - that should only be done
