Before attempting to compile, ensure that there is a link from the current berkeley Db Java binary (found in dbjava) to dbjava/je.jar.

On Windows systems, simply copy the current Berkeley DB/Java binary in dbjava to je.jar

The build of the original installer is not included and currently disabled as it will be replaced with the new installer shortly.

See docs/dev-guide.html for additional information on building blitz but once the steps above have been performed a build can be done with:

ant clean
ant compile

A basic release can be built with:

ant clean
ant release

A working set of jars can build with:

ant clean
ant jars
