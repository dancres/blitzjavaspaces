<P>
This package contains the core instrumentation framework which is used to 
track various statistics within the Blitz core.
</P>

<p>
The statistics which are generated/gathered can be controlled both 
programmatically and via the configuration file.
</p>

<p>
The philosophy behind this package is to provide administrators/developers
with "low cost" (demanding little CPU time) feedback about Blitz's activities.
In summary, the approach is similar to that taken with the types of statistic
available via SNMP-enabled devices.
