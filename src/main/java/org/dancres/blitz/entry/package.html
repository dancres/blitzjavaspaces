<P> The blitz storage engine lives in this package and is responsible for
storage and indexing of MangledEntry instances. It is built around the concept
of virtual memory with EntrySleeves being the equivalent of pages which can
be cached or written to Storage instances. </P>

<P> EntrySleeves contain a certain amount of transient information 
(SleeveState) which is used to manage them whilst they are cached in
memory </P>

<P> EntrySleeves may be pinned in memory using the PINNED flag.  This
prevents any state changes made from being reflected to disk (this is most
often used to prevent writes getting to disk until the containing
transaction has commited). Other flags identify dirty, deleted or never
written EntrySleeves which determines what should be done when EntrySleeve
state is sync'd back to disk. </P>

<P> Recently written entries are not immediately written to disk (though they
are logged) on the assumption that these Entries might well be immediately
taken which has the potential to save us a disk write/delete cycle. </P>

<P> Note: flushing in this context means removal from the cache and can only
occur after sync'ing which is the copying of appropriate state to disk. Of
course, if the state of an EntrySleeve hasn't changed disk needn't be updated.
</P>

<p> Storage management is mostly done in EntryStorage which delegates a lot
of responsibility to WriteScheduler (manages PINNED Sleeves).
WriteScheduler delegates handling of updates to WriteBuffer which
asynchronously updates disk via WriteDaemon.  We use asynchronous writing
because it allows the upper layers to avoid waiting for disks to perform an
operation.</p>
