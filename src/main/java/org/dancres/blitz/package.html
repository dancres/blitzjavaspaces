<P> This package contains the core space implementation.  It is only dimly
aware of remoteness which is implemented in package org.dancres.blitz.remote.

<p> This all got started one day after I'd been reading an article in Login
magazine (a publication of Usenix) - "One up on LRU" which presented a new
caching algorithm out of IBM research.  The properties of this algorithm were,
I thought, well suited to the potential variations in access patterns
JavaSpaces implementations can encounter "in the field".  How could I make this
work fit into a JavaSpace implementation?  My solution was to adopt an
approach similar to that used in operating systems - virtual memory/paging.
Thus the code-writing began....</p>
