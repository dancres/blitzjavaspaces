<P> This package implements the remote layer.  As well as the more obvious
space-related methods, these classes must handle the dispatching of lease
renewal, admin requests and transaction management.
</P>

<p> This package is also responsible for handling shutdown and the various
security aspects </p>

<p> Note that all stubs are wrapped in proxies to prevent direct access to
the stub which, of course, implements all interfaces.  Someone that requires
the TransactionParticipant remote reference shouldn't be able to "see"
JoinAdmin, for example. </p>

<p> This package is intended to be used via the JINI ServiceStarter package but can be run via a test skeleton</p>
