<p>Generic ARC caching implementation.  This package makes a few assumptions
as modelled in the interfaces:

<ol>
<li> It caches the contents of a BackingStore implementation which may be
disk-based, network-based or whatever.</li>
<li> Each entity implements the Identifiable interface indicating that it
has the property of being uniquely-identifiable. </li>
<li> Each entity is identified by an instance of the opaque type, Identifier.
</li>
</ol>
