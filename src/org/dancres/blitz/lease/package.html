<P> This package contains the leasing subsystem.  Various kinds of leases
need to be renewed in slightly different ways depending on their type.  This
package adds a further level of abstraction which allows most code to deal in
the concept of a single, global space identifier which can be leased whilst
renewals/cancels are internally dispatched to the appropriate subsystem.
