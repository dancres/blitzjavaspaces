<P> This package contains various bits of debugging code for use with the
remote layer.
</P>

<p> At this moment, there is a generic DebugILFactory implementation which can
be used to replace the usual ILFactory in a configured Endpoint and causes the
standard InvocationHandler to be replaced with one of the programmer's choice.
By default, DebugILFactory creates instances of TimingInvocationHandler.</p>
