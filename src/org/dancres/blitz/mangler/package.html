<P> Entry instances have certain properties which we do not wish to be
handling in the storage engine (blitz.disk) such as loading of remote classes
etc.  At the same time, we wish to provide the storage engine with a means
to compare such Entry instances for purposes of matching. </P>

<P> This package converts an Entry to and from an object structure which hides
the undesirable properties of an Entry (such as the need to load it's bytecode)
from the rest of the blitz code. </P>

<P> The object structure is, in fact, MangledEntry instances of which are
created by EntryManglers and contain a field by field representation of the
original Entry made up of MangledFields </P>

<P> MangledEntry's can be compared with the match method providing the basic
primitive required to perform matching of templates against Entry's </P>
